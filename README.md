# bezelproject for SteamOS

This fork modify the original Bezel Project installer script to be compatible with SteamOS/Steam Deck.

This is a still a work in progres. But I have tested the installation on Steam Deck OLED (EmuDeck RetroArch installation).

Please feel free to open an issue for bugs or suggest features.

**For full project description, refer to the official repo.**

## TODO
- Provide options to enable the following overlay config in RetroArch
    - `overlay behind menu`
    - `hide in menu`
- Options to enable/disable overlay
- Option to list ROM that doesn't have bezel installed for a specific system
- Option to uninstall the whole project
